Let's think about creating a new universe. Sounds pretty complicated, but there is nothing impossible with Swift Language.
 
This line of code below creates a new world, uncomment it to see results:

*/
 World.create(columns: 90, rows: 130)
/*:
 Now you are able to see our world. Fill free to change size properties to what you want, feel some power in your hands!!!

 So, our world already includes randomly generated entities. But it is static, looks boring.
 
 Next line of code will breathe some life to this entities, uncomment it:
 */
 World.startLife(oneGenerationDuration: 0.01)
/*:
 They alive! Yeah, you can even change duration of one generation life! Time is under your power! Isn't it amazing?

- [Yeah, it is!](@next)
