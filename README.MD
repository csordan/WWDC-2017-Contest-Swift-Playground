# WWDC-2017-Contest-Swift-Playground

This was my submission to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 Scholarship application. 

Instructions: 

Create a visually interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Be creative. You can use Swift Playgrounds on iPad or Xcode on macOS. If you need inspiration, start with templates in Swift Playgrounds for a head start on more advanced creations. Get inventive and make them your own by adding graphics, audio, and more.
